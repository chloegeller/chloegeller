### Hey there, Iâ€™m ChloÃ«! ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm currently a Research Assistant in the *Computation, Cognition, and Development* ([**CoCoDev**](https://cocodev.org)) **Lab** at Harvard. During the Summer of 2021, I was in the *MIT Summer Research Program - Bio* ([**MSRP-Bio/CBMM**](https://bcs.mit.edu/diversity/mit-summer-research-program-biology-and-brain-and-cognitive-neuroscience-msrp-bio)) as a Research Intern in the **CoCoDev Lab**.

I recently graduated from the [University of Central Florida](https://www.ucf.edu/) (UCF) with a **B.S in Computer Science** and minors in Math, Robotics, and Cognitive Sciences. I am actively looking for Machine Learning, Data, and/or Software Engineering positions.

I recently started a [blog](https://chloegeller.com/post) on my website where I'll be discussing neurodivergence, and how I perceive the world. 

During my time at UCF I held a few positions, and was involved in student organizations on campus.

*2020 - 2021:*
- President of the Association for Computing Machinery [(ACM)](http://ucf.acm.org) at UCF.
- President of ACM - Women in Tech [(ACM-W)](https://ucfacmw.org) at UCF.
- Vice President of [AI@UCF](https://ucfai.org).
- I held an undergrad research position in the [NLP Group](http://www.nlp.cs.ucf.edu/) at UCF.
  
*2019 - 2020:*
- Secretary, and Mentorship Director of [ACM-W](https://ucfacmw.org) at UCF.
- Communications Director of [AI@UCF](https://ucfai.org).
