### Hey there, I’m Chloë! 👋 

I'm currently in the *MIT Summer Research Program - Bio* ([**MSRP-Bio**](https://bcs.mit.edu/diversity/mit-summer-research-program-biology-and-brain-and-cognitive-neuroscience-msrp-bio)), and doing research in the *Computation, Cognition, and Development* ([**CoCoDev**](https://cocodev.org)) Lab at Harvard.

I'm in my third year at the [University of Central Florida](https://www.ucf.edu/) (UCF), majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Math, Robotics, and Cognitive Sciences.

I recently started a [blog](https://chloegeller.com/post) on my website where I'll be discussing neurodivergence, and how I perceive the world. 

During my time at UCF I've held a few positions, and have been involved in student organizations on campus.

*2020 - 2021:*
- President of the Association for Computing Machinery [(ACM)](http://ucf.acm.org).
- President of the Association for Computing Machinery - Women in Tech [(ACM-W)](https://ucfacmw.org).
- Vice President of [AI@UCF](https://ucfai.org).
- I held an undergrad research position in the [NLP Group](http://www.nlp.cs.ucf.edu/) at UCF.
  
*2019 - 2020:*
- Secretary, and Mentorship Director of [ACM-W](https://ucfacmw.org).
- Communications Director of [AI@UCF](https://ucfai.org).
- Resident Assistant, [Housing and Residence Life](https://www.housing.ucf.edu/employment/resident-assistant/).
