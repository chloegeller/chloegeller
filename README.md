### Hey there, Iâ€™m ChloÃ«! ðŸ‘‹ 

Iâ€™m in my fourth year at the [University of Central Florida](https://ucf.edu). Iâ€™m majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Math, Robotics, and Cognitive Sciences.

I recently started as a Research Assistant in the [NLP Group](http://www.nlp.cs.ucf.edu/) at UCF. 

Iâ€™m involved in a few student organizations on campus. Currently, Iâ€™m the President of the Association for Computing Machinery ([ACM])(http://ucf.acm.org) & ACM - Women in Tech ([ACM-W](https://ucfacmw.org)). Iâ€™m also the Vice President of [AI@UCF](https://ucfai.org).
